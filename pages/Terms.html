        <h3>1. 3D X-ray dental computed tomography by Osstem T2, South Korea.</h3>
        <p>T2 is a digital X-ray imaging unit for dental professionals that converts X-ray signals into digital
            signals to acquire 2D images and reconstruct them into 3D images, using Pano, Cephalo and CT technology
            for the diagnosis of anatomical structures of oral and maxillofacial areas. T2 features a 3 in 1 system,
            which incorporates 3D, CT, Pano & Cephalo (Optional) imaging into one imaging system</p>
        <h3>2. Vatech EzSensor Intra-Oral Sensor.</h3>
        <h4>EzSensor is an innovative digital intraoral sensor from VATECH. EzSensor is excellent image quality for
            quick and fast diagnosis.</h4>
        <p>Advantages
            Rounded shape, smooth edges and absence of sharp corners increase diagnostic accuracy and provide
            maximum
            comfort for the patient.
            A rugged aluminum inner shell and vibration-absorbing design make the EzSensor extremely user-friendly,
            reliable and durable.
            The special design of the probe-to-cable connection greatly enhances the clarity and stability of the
            digital image, while providing unparalleled freedom of movement and accuracy even when changing the
            position
            of the probe frequently or quickly. <br>
            The highest image quality and image accuracy that the EzSensor is capable of making it an indispensable
            tool when planning endodontic treatment or implant surgery
            EzSensor increases the efficiency of the clinic, as it does not require a specially equipped room for
            developing images and allows you to reduce the time of a diagnostic examination by several times</p>

        <h3>4. Russian autoclave bk75, Autoclave B class, dry heat oven.</h3>
        <p>Steam sterilizer VK-75-01 new version. <br>
            In the new modification of the popular model of the steam sterilizer VK-75-01, all the main stages of
            sterilization are automated, which significantly reduces the risk of errors and simplifies the work with the
            steam autoclave. The lid design has been improved, opening and closing of the steam autoclave has become
            more convenient. <br>
            Steam medical sterilizer is designed for pressure steam sterilization of dressings, surgical instruments,
            gloves and other medical supplies that do not deteriorate when exposed to steam. The steam pressure in the
            sterilization chamber is maintained automatically.</p>

        <h2>Dental treatment is one of those areas of medicine where there are supplies that are in close contact with
            patients. Each examination and any dental manipulation reveals interaction with mucous tissues, often
            affected by infections, therefore, compliance with the rules of hygiene, disinfection and sterilization in
            dentistry is the number one rule.</h2>
        <p>The main stages of sterilization of dental instruments</p>
        <h3>1. Disinfection.</h3>
        <p>Any dental instruments (we are talking about reusable products) must go through this stage of processing. The
            procedure for plastic, ceramic tips and, for example, all-metal instruments (knives, elevators) will differ
            only in the choice of antiseptics. <br>
            Disinfection can be done manually or using special equipment for this purpose. The principle of operation of
            a chemical sterilizer is simple: you need to put the tools in a special container and lower it into a
            container filled with a disinfectant solution. The residence time in the solution depends on its
            concentration and the type of dental instrument.</p>
        <h3>2. Pre-sterilization.</h3>
        <p>After treatment with a chemical antiseptic, the instruments must be washed in ordinary water (each
            separately) for about a minute, then rinsed under running water for several minutes. Then the instruments
            are washed in distilled water (treatment time - 1 minute). Brushes can be used for pre-sterilization
            treatment of solid, smooth products. Items with numerous notches, with an abrasive surface are best cleaned
            in an ultrasonic sterilizer. Ultrasound sterilization of diamond-coated dental burs is a simple and fast
            pre-sterilization treatment. The instrumentation is placed in the container of the ultrasound machine. Then,
            a disinfectant solution is poured into the apparatus and the cleaning time is set. The equipment does all
            the work for you automatically. The treated tool is dried in a dryer and packaged.</p>
        <h3>3. Package.</h3>
        <p>This stage is relevant if steam sterilization of dental instruments is planned. Packing will require special
            bags or a packing machine. The tool must be placed in a bag that matches its size and sealed. The packaging
            machine simplifies the packaging process. It comes with a roll of packaging film. When sealing instruments,
            the length and width of the packaging material can be adjusted.</p>
        <h3>4. Sterilization</h3>
        <p>Packaged instruments are sterilized in an autoclave:
            they are placed on a special pallet;
            bags should lie paper layer up and not overlap each other;
            then set the desired temperature, sterilization mode;
            further autoclaving occurs automatically.
            The sterilized dental instrument is stored in a packaged form in a dry place.</p>
